Repository for my sticker app

Hey everybody, thanks for stopping by the github repository that I created for my sticker pack on the App Store. There isn't really anything interesting
to see on this page, but I needed a link to publish the app so here it is. There's no code, because Apple does all the hard work in making sticker packs
(they better, for the 99 dollars a year I pay for this). If you need to reach me for some reason (I cannot possibly imagine why) shoot an email to
csandall2@gmail.com.
